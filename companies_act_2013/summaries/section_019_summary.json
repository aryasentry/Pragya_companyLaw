It specifically prohibits allotment or transfer of shares from a holding company to its subsidiaries unless certain conditions are met, such as when the subsidiary holds shares as legal representatives of deceased shareholders or trustees. The key requirements include prohibiting void allotments and ensuring that only members can vote on matters concerning their own shares. This section applies to all companies under the Act, including those with no share capital.",
